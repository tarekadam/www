            <p>Currently in Beta Release, TrafficJam is built to track all the activity around an online business,
                rather than just website analytics. So you'll finally know who reads your posts, who opens your emails,
                who clicks your links, what websites your ads are placed on, ... and track them all the way to a
                transaction... even if it takes months for that stranger to become a follower and then a buyer. In
                addition, TrafficJam provides powerful A/B engines to hone your messaging and then track the
                improvements in traffic flows.
